# My Portfolio

## Description
This project is a new portfolio showcasing my UX and UI skill development, and to help hone my Front End development skills. 
It has an introduction page that states a little about me, a work page that shows some of my projects, an illustration page that has examples of my artwork, an about me page, and a contact page. 

I use a minimal dark design throughout with the exception of an artwork component on the illustration page that is very colorful.

Parallax is abundant as are subtle effects. 

Key events open hidden elements.
